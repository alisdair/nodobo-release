# User 19

User 19 lost the phone on December 17th 2010. No further records exist
since then.

# User 26

User 26's device appears to have a severe malfunction. This is
particularly unfortunate because this user made a large number of
calls and text messages.

The user's self-report indicates problems with the phone, and
study-wide call and message corroboration results support this. Of
those recorded by user 26, most calls (67%) and messages (87%) were
corroborated by the other user. Conversely, of the calls and messages
recorded by others, user 26 only corroborated 17% and 48%
respectively.

# Users leaving the study

User 4 elected to leave the study due to a malfunctioning phone. This
user's data ends on 2010-10-18, and is unreliable before then.

User 23 unfortunately had two broken phones in a row, and chose to
leave the study. This user's data ends on 2010-09-22 with almost no
data recorded.

User 16 left the study, switching to a new phone. This user's data
ends on 2010-12-04.

# Users leaving school

Users 2, 10, 18, 20, and 25 left school at the end of 2010. Many of
these users continued to use the phones, but presence data patterns
may have changed due to non-attendance of school.
